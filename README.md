# DS_projects 

This repo is the showroom of my projects. You can check how I improved my skills step by step from analytics to fitting neural networks.

### [1. Data_pre-processing](https://github.com/IaroslavKonev/DS_projects/tree/main/1-Data_pre-processing)
**Borrower Reliability research**

The client is the credit department of the bank. We need to understand whether the marital status and number of children of the client affects the fact of repayment of the loan on time. Input data from the bank - statistics on the solvency of customers.

The results of the study will be taken into account when building a credit scoring model - a special system that evaluates the potential borrower's ability to repay the loan to the bank.

### [2. Exploratory_Data_Analysis](https://github.com/IaroslavKonev/DS_projects/tree/main/2-Exploratory_Data_Analysis)
**Real estate analysis**

We have at your disposal the data of Yandex.Real Estate - an archive of advertisements for apartments for sale in St. Petersburg and neighboring localities for several years. In the future it will be necessary to learn how to determine the market value of real estate, but for now our task is to set the parameters. This will allow to build an automated system: it will trace the anomalies and fraudulent activities.

Two types of data are available for each apartment for sale. The first is entered by the user, the second is automatically obtained on the basis of map data. For example, the distance to the center, the airport, the nearest park and body of water.

### [3. Statistical_Data_Analysis](https://github.com/IaroslavKonev/DS_projects/tree/main/3-Statistical_Data_Analysis)

**Statistical research to find a promising telecom company tariff**

We have to do a preliminary analysis of tariffs on a small sample of customers. We have at our disposal the data of 500 "Megaline" users: who they are, where they come from, what tariff they use, how many calls and messages each sent in 2018. We need to analyze customer behavior and draw a conclusion as to which tariff is better.

### [4. Project_(DPP-EDA-SDA)](https://github.com/IaroslavKonev/DS_projects/tree/main/4-Project_(DPP-EDA-SDA))

**A project to find and analyze patterns of success in computer games. A composite project containing an integrated use of the previous themes.**

Historical data on game sales, user and expert evaluations, genres and platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation) are available from open sources. We need to identify the patterns that determine a game's success. This will allow us to bet on a potentially popular product and plan advertising campaigns.

### [5. Machine_Learning_(DPP-EDA-SDA)](https://github.com/IaroslavKonev/DS_projects/tree/main/5-Machine_Learning)

**Binary Classification Training Project**

We have data on the behavior of customers who have already switched to these rates (from the course project "Statistical Data Analysis"). You need to build a model for the classification problem, which selects the right fare. No preprocessing of the data is needed - we have already done it.

Build a model with as much accuracy as possible. To pass the project successfully, you need to get the percentage of correct answers to at least 0.75. Check the accuracy on the test sample yourself

### [6. Supervised_Learning](https://github.com/IaroslavKonev/DS_projects/tree/main/6-Supervised_Learning)

**Building a predictive model of bank customer churn**

Clients began to leave Beta Bank. Every month. Not much, but noticeable. The bank's marketing experts figured it was cheaper to keep current customers than to attract new ones.

You need to predict whether a client will leave the bank in the near future or not. You are provided with historical data on customer behavior and termination of contracts with the bank.

Construct a model with an extremely high value of F1-measure. To pass the project successfully, you need to bring the metric to 0.59. Test F1-measure on the test sample by yourself.

Additionally measure AUC-ROC, compare its value with F1-measure.

### [7. Catboost_GridSearchCV](https://github.com/IaroslavKonev/DS_projects/tree/main/7-Catboost_GridSearchCV)

**Classic ML-project with using GridSearch and pipeline**

Task: Build a predictive model for a dataset with UCI Machine Learning: pre-process the categorical features, select them, assemble a validation scheme, and select models with it. Dataset description at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Drug+consumption+%28quantified%29

### [8. Custom_class_and_pipelines](https://github.com/IaroslavKonev/DS_projects/tree/main/8-Custom_class_and_pipelines)

**Classic ML-project with Custom Classes**

Task: Write a binary classifier using a custom class for preprocessing data and generating new features. Evaluate the importance of the features.

### [9. NLP](https://github.com/IaroslavKonev/DS_projects/tree/main/9-NLP)

**NLP-projects**

Some tasks for binary classification.

Two types of classifiers are implemented here. 

1. Sentiment_analysis. With TF-IDF - vectorization and Linear regression. 
2. Searching specific cases. Using BERT. I wrote 2 custom classes. They can also be used to train multiclassifiers

### [10. Computer_vision](https://github.com/IaroslavKonev/DS_projects/tree/main/10-Computer_Vision)

**CV-projects**

In this task we need to develop a neural network to determine the age of a person from his photo.
